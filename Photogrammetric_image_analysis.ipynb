    "To compute the accuracy of the projected points onto image 3 (florence3.jpg), we typically need a set of known, accurate points to compare against the projected points. These known points, known as 'ground truth,' are manually annotated or obtained from reliable sources, representing the true locations where the points from image 1 (florence1) and image 2 (florence2) should appear on image 3.  However, the image provided does not contain this ground truth data, so we can't compute accuracy in the traditional sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, if we had such ground truth points, we could compute the accuracy by measuring the Euclidean distance between the projected points and the ground truth points. Smaller distances indicate higher accuracyâ€”meaning the projected points closely align with the expected true positions. This comparison assists in evaluating how accurately the projection aligns with the intended positions in image 3, providing insight into the alignment quality of the projected points with their expected locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection errors may arise due to various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calibration Issues: Inaccurate camera calibration parameters or inconsistencies in the camera model used for the computation of fundamental matrices can cause projection inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image deformation: If the images have undergone significant transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or non-planar motion, the computed projection may not accurately reflect the corresponding points in the third image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inaccuracies in the fundamental matrix: The fundamental matrix is estimated from the images, and any inaccuracies in the estimation can lead to projection errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorrect Correspondences: If the selected corresponding points in images 1 and 2 are not accurately matched, it can lead to errors in computing the epipolar lines, resulting in inaccurate projection onto image 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also reasons like missing depth information, algorithm limitations and image deformation can cause projection error."
